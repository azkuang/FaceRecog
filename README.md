# Facial Recognition with Real-Time Performance and Arduino Integration

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a facial recognition model optimized for real-time performance using OpenCV's Haar-cascade detection. The model is integrated with an Arduino for camera control, allowing for dynamic face tracking and capturing.

### Features:
- **Real-time Facial Recognition**: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar-cascade to detect and track faces with optimized performance.
- **Arduino Camera Control**: Integrated with an Arduino to enable camera movement and tracking based on detected face position.
- **AI-powered Detection**: Applied AI techniques to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- **OpenCV**: For face detection and image processing.
- **Python**: Backend for handling detection logic and communication with Arduino.
- **Arduino**: Controls camera motion and interacts with the facial recognition model.

## Prerequisites

- **OpenCV**: Install using `pip install opencv-python`.
- **Arduino**: Set up the Arduino IDE and ensure the appropriate libraries for serial communication are installed.
- **Python**: Python 3.6+ is recommended.
